 ## v2.0

This version of the project summarizes two days of work on creating the first prototype. Over several days, I have been working with various AI tools to develop my first webstore from scratch.

So far, I have made significant progress. During the first version, the development focused primarily on the aesthetics of the website and its main structure, the "home page." For this, I drew inspiration from the visual experience of websites like [Apple](https://www.apple.com/co/) and [Mac Center](https://mac-center.com/). This 2.0 version will be more focused on functionality, including:
- Links to other pages on the website
- Some visual effects
- Payment gateway
- Redirection to other platforms that contribute to the overall UX idea of shopping in the webstore

It will also add other pages like "Contact," "Follow Us," and "About Us," so that version 3.0 can focus on improving its visual aspects. I will use **Figma** and **Jamboard** to document the development process and have a reference of how I developed the website, enabling me to optimize the process in future projects.

I asked my AI assistant to provide us with a technical summary, which I will leave below...

Sincerely,

**Jose Ramon Garcia**

Alright Jose, let me clearly explain our work so far...

I'll provide you with a technical resume of the project as it stands now.

## Technical Resume of AirPods Cartagena Project

### 1. Framework and Language:
- **Next.js** (implied by the use of Next.js specific components)
- **TypeScript** (as evidenced by the .tsx file extension and type annotations)

### 2. UI Components and Styling:
- **Custom UI Components** (e.g., Button) imported from `@/components/ui`
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling (inferred from the use of utility classes)
- **Responsive Design** implemented with Tailwind's responsive classes

### 3. State Management:
- **React's useState Hook** for local state management (e.g., imageError state)

### 4. Animations and Interactions:
- **Framer Motion Library** for animations and transitions

### 5. Icons:
- **Lucide React** for icon components (ShoppingCart, Heart, Star, Check)

### 6. Image Handling:
- **Next.js Image Component** for optimized image loading
- **Error Handling** for image loading failures

### 7. Routing:
- **Next.js Link Component** for internal navigation

### 8. Page Structure:
- Single page application structure with distinct sections:
  - **Header** (with navigation)
  - **Main Content** (product description, images, features, pricing)
  - **Footer**

### 9. Responsive Layout:
- **Grid System** for layout (`grid-cols-2` for image gallery)
- **Flexbox** for component layouts

### 10. Accessibility:
- **Semantic HTML Elements** (header, main, footer, section)
- **ARIA Attributes** not explicitly used, but could be improved

### 11. Performance Optimizations:
- **Image Optimization** through Next.js Image component
- **Lazy Loading** of off-screen images (implicit in Next.js Image)

### 12. Internationalization:
- Content is in Spanish, suggesting a localized version

### 13. Interactivity:
- **Hover Effects** on buttons and images
- **Scroll-based Header Styling**

### 14. Error Handling:
- **Basic Error Handling** for image loading

### 15. Build and Development:
- Assumed to be using **Next.js Build System**
- **TypeScript Compilation**

### 16. Deployment:
- Not specified, but likely deployable to **Vercel** or other Next.js-compatible hosting platforms

### 17. Version Control:
- Not specified, but assumed to be using **Git**

### 18. Dependencies:
- **React**
- **Next.js**
- **Framer Motion**
- **Lucide React**
- **Tailwind CSS**
- **TypeScript**

### 19. Code Organization:
- Single component file (`BuyPage`) with potential for modularization

### 20. Potential Areas for Improvement:
- Server-side rendering capabilities of **Next.js** not explicitly utilized
- Could benefit from more **modular component structure**
- **State Management** could be enhanced for larger scale applications
- **SEO Optimizations** could be implemented (e.g., meta tags)

This technical resume provides an overview of the current state of your AirPods Cartagena project, highlighting the technologies, structure, and key features implemented so far.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
